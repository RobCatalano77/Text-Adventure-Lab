Title: Shia Surprise

Opening Scene: You are lost deep in the woods, confused, and tired. You have no idea what happened to your friends or the camp site, so you are completely alone. You need to find a way back to some sort of civilization soon, before it gets too dark. Suddenly, you hear something rustle in the bushes about 200 feet behind you. You turn to see Hollywood superstar Shia LeBouf, covered in blood, eerily grinning at you with the look of death in his eyes. He has a knife and starts to walk towards you. You must survive. What do you do? 

Setting: woods, cabin, cave, river

Entities: bear trap, baseball bat, rifle

Actions: walk, run, shoot, hide, scream

End game: The game will end when  Shia LeBouf is dead. Shia's death can happen in two ways: You can hit him in the head with the baseball bat, or shoot him with the rifle.
